# local-cloud

Looking for contributors. Please check the future plans if you wish to contribute and make a pull request.

This program can turn your desktop into a local cloud server. This is a website which will run locally over your wifi(
without port forwarding) and will be accessible to all your devices.

You can now access and transfer files from your different devices with ease. The new version (version 2) has been
implemented using vuejs. Version 1 was a pilot project and is not recommended for use(it is not supported by me any
longer).

## Version 2.4 is Here

### What's new

- Log the contents on the server console (The logging is colour coded)

    - Red = Error/Delete
    - Green = Access Files/ Download
    - Blue = Upload/ Create new folder

- Fixed bug - earlier if you uploaded a file that exists in root, into some subfolder, the root file would get deleted.
- Several minor bugs fixed.
- File Upload size increased to 60,000 MB from 256MB
- Executables have been made available (since version 2.3)

## Version 2.3 is Here

### What's new

- Delete Files
- Download from releases, the app is finally PACKAGED as an executable!! You don't need to download nodejs or anything
  else anymore
- delete folder (in context menu- right click)
- download entire folder (in context menu- right click)
- Upload folder has shifted to home directory
    - For windows => Users > username > HomeCloud
- You don't need to look for your ipv4 address anymore, it displays it for you

<a id="access"></a>

## How to access the website/Setup Procedure :key:

<b>Version 2(vuejs implementation)</b>
<br />
If your wish to set it up for development follow these steps, else check the releases for a better bundled package

1. There are 2 main folders server and client, the vuejs code is inside client and the express backend code is inside
   server

2. open up 2 terminals/cmd in the root folder.

    ```bash
    TERMINAL 1
    yarn install
    yarn start

    TERMINAL 2
    cd client
    yarn install
    yarn serve
    ```

3. The website can be found on ipv4:8080, ~~check version 1 procedure to see how you can find your ipv4 address~~. From
   version 2.4 onwards the ip address is displayed for you, visit that on any device on the same network.

<b>For version 1</b>
<br />

1. Open your desired terminal/command prompt - cmd, terminal, git bash on the computer you plan to use as your cloud
   server

2. Type `ipconfig` and find the IPv4 address

3. The website will be available on IPv4 Address:5000 For example: 192.168.1.7:5000

4. To start the server run the following 2 commands

    ```bash
    yarn install
    yarn start
    ```

5. You can access the website on any device at that address

<a id="plans"></a>

## Future Plans and Timeline :bulb:

- [x] Pilot project with vanilla html-css and js
- [x] Implement with vuejs
- [x] Fix some UI issues - aligning etc
- [x] Create Folders
- [x] Download Files
- [x] Upload Files
- [x] Delete files
- [x] View File size
- [x] Delete Folders
- [x] Download entire folder(as a zip)
- [x] Coloured logging of events (for server console)
- [x] Implement some security features - Restricted access to other files on the system by blocking requests outside the
  home directory - This has been done for navigation(getting directory content), for downloading files and folders and
  for deleting files or folders
  - [ ] File Chunking/Streaming for smoother downloads of larger files *currently working on this*
- [ ] Improve UI
- [ ] Password protect files (for downloading on other devices)
- [ ] Non downloadable files
- [ ] Move files into different directories
- [ ] Updated docker support -> *Currently not working*

## Development oriented plans :bulb:

- Clean unnecessary code
- Make API RESTFUL
- make various synchronous processes asynchronous
- Reduce dependencies

<br />

## Some useful new features

- Check file size
- ctrl + click on file to download directly
- Right click folder for context menu
